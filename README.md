## Description

As COVID-19 continues to become a greater problem, the need for online school has become more and more prominent. However, for the first 2 years, video conferencing platforms such as zoom have proved to provide little to no engagement leading to students' attentive levels constantly decreasing and online learning becoming less effective. However, spat!al aims to elevate the virtual classroom experience by creating a realistic environment that creates the exact ambiance of the inside of a real classroom. This is through our eye-tracking and spatial audio apps that contribute in enhancing student-teacher connections, more realistic engagement and health benefits for instructors and students which overall helps improve the quality of online education. The eye-tracking app enables instructors to monitor the attentiveness of the class and use the overall attentiveness score to tailor their teaching methods and alter curriculums throughout the year. For example, through these analytics, teachers would be able to easily identify weak spots throughout the lectures where the attentive rate is significantly low. Furthermore, the spatial audio app would allow students to hear other neighbors and teacher voices around the class just like they would in a real classroom or lecture theatre. For example, if a student were in the middle of the class their sound would be heard from the backsides and the front.

## Most Impactful Features of the Project 
1. The face-tracker tracks if the face of the student is on or off the screen and its duration of how long they are on-screen. If the student looks away the tracker acknowledges this and contributes it to the overall attention span score of the class.

2. The spatial audio in the app allows users to experience the classroom feeling from anywhere. This means that it provides instructors with the ability to create a real classroom environment. Furthermore, it allows students to be more involved in the classroom activities.

4. Provides instructors and students with health benefits as they can monitor the time spent on screens by students. This information can be used to tailor make classes to implement offline activites to reduce strain on the eyes.
